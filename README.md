## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of multiple machine learning models and their effectiveness in predicting wild blueberry yields. This study covers the following key aspects:

- **Data Collection**: Acquiring and preprocessing the dataset related to wild blueberry yields, including features such as soil moisture, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing thorough data analysis to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on yield.
- **Model Selection**: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
- **Performance Metrics**: Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate and compare model performance.
- **Visualization**: Providing visual representations of data distributions, model predictions, and performance comparisons.
